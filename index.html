        <h1>Learning to Program</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <article>
        <p> What is the nature of my study habits? It's been three months since my first commit
            and I am still exploring. I need to pick a path and stay on it. I can't let work or friends
            distract me from my main objective. I don't want three months to turn into three years. 
        </p>
        <p><span><Strong>What is my main objective?</Strong></span>I studied international business management 
        and I enjoyed that a lot. Currently I lead a team of 2 developers while also being the Product Owner
        in SCRUM terms. And I like being in charge, but I don't like the fact that I don't have the 
        technical knowledge to lead the team the right way. It's as if I started at the goal and I am 
        building my skills top to bottom. So then, again, Alex. <em>What is my objective?</em> Well, I
        want to learn to program really well, so I can lead the team technically and not just businessly.
        </p>
        <p>Of course sometimes I think I could be using my time in other ways. I have enough business 
        skills to open a local or online store, and there are a couple of things I could do really well
        like import asian goods and sell them here, in Mexico... but I don't like the idea of giving up
        on programming. I've wanted to learn to program since I was little and I've always put other
        people's interests before mine. And it's not that I am beeing selfish, because the <em> reason I want
        to learn to program is to help businesses grow.</em>
